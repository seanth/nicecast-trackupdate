trackupdate polls Apple Music every 10 seconds for information about the
currently playing track and hands this information to target plugins to
perform various tasks. The currently included plugins are:

- StdioTarget - Prints the current artist and track to stdout (aka "the
  terminal")
- AudioHijackTarget - Places the current track info into Audio Hijack's
  "NowPlaying.txt" file
- LadioCastTarget - Updates the metadata in Ladiocast using Applescript
- ListFileTarget - Creates some text files which can easily be pasted into
  Mediawiki and HTML, and also creates a simple track list text file
- SlackTarget - Posts track info into a Slack channel
- TwitterTarget - Posts each track's artist and name to a twitter account
  specified in the .rc file.  Requires that python-twitter is installed
  (http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/)

trackupdate and some of its plugins require configuration data, which is
stored in a file named ~/.trackupdaterc. See example-trackupdaterc for
details on the various configuration options.

While this script is running, you may notice a persistent bouncing dock icon
for python.  This annoyed me, so I removed it by editing:

/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/Resources/Python.app/Contents/Info.plist

and adding the following key to the <dict> tag:
    <key>NSUIElement</key>
    <string>1</string>
